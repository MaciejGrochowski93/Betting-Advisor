        <h2>What is the Betting Advisor?</h2>
            <section>
            <p>In order to achieve success you need to catch every single opportunity that gives you advantage.</p>
            <p> After watching sports and betting industry for many years, I came to the conclusion: betting is nothing else than mathemetical calculation.

            <h3>Calculate Probability</h3>
            <p>Just like in real life, everything in betting is possible, every player can score a goal, every team can lose the match. The question is, how probable is the result? If you want to make a good bet, you should think what are the real chances of your favorite and compare them with probability implied by the betting odds.</p>
            <p>If the probability implied by bookmaker's odds is higher than your own probability, perhaps you should just avoid betting on the match.</p>

            <h3>Calculate Odds</h3>
            <p>Let's think about situation, when you haven't seen the odds yet, but you know how many percent chances to win your favorite got.
                This calculator lets you count up the odds that reflect your probability, and compare them with the actual odds.</p>
            <p>If bookmaker offers better odds, perhaps it could be worth to take your chance?</p>

            <h3>Reverse Odds</h3>
            <p> Every time you place a bet, you let someone else place a bet against you - both sides take the risk, only one will win. If you bet $10 at odds 2.00, you risk $10 to win $10. In reality, you let bookmaker place an opposite bet against you. You obviously know what odds you are placing, but it's good to know what odds you are accepting against yourself.
            </p>
            <p>Just type the odds you consider placing, convert them and see if you're comfortable to accept the opposite bet against yourself.</p>

            <h3>Surebet Calculator</h3>
            <p>Most of the times, all the bookmakers offer very similar odds. The reason behind that is if the differences in odds would be significant, the smart players could just place a bet in bookie X, opposite bet in bookie Y, and eventually end up with a profit. In theory that's impossible... But sometimes bookmakers have some delay in updates of their offer.
            </p>
            <p>The Surebet Calculator will check if you can potentially take a risk-free bet out of the given odds, and tell you how to spread the money you want to place.</p>
